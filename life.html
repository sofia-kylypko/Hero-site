                <h1>EARLY AGES </h1>
                <p><span>Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in Tokyo City</span>, Empire of Japan. During World War Two, Miyazaki Aircraft, which produced rudders for fighter planes, was run by his father, Katsuji Miyazaki. Throughout Miyazaki's early years, the family's wealth was maintained thanks to the company. Although Miyazaki's father had little recognized creative knowledge, he liked to buy paintings and show them to visitors. <span>Miyazaki believed that his father had never said anything "lofty or inspiring" and that he had frequently glanced at him unfavorably. </span>He believed that he had acquired his father's "anarchistic feelings and his lack of worry about embracing contradictions" and lamented not having a meaningful conversation with him.</p>
                <p><span>Some of Miyazaki's early recollections are of "bombed-out cities," the author has stated.</span> When Miyazaki was three years old, his family fled to Utsunomiya. He and his family fled to Kanuma in July 1945 following the bombardment of Utsunomiya. <span>The explosion had a profound effect on Miyazaki, who was four years old at the time.</span></p>
                <p>At a primary school in Utsunomiya, Miyazaki started attending classes in 1947 and attended first through third years there. Miyazaki finished the fourth grade at Miya Elementary School and the fifth grade at Eifuku Elementary School after his family relocated back to Suginami-ku. Following his time at Miya Junior High School. <span>He wanted to be a manga artist but found he couldn't sketch humans; for years, he only drew battleships, tanks, and aircraft.</span> Numerous comics creators, including Tetsuji Fukushima, Soji Yamakawa, and Osamu Tezuka, had an impact on Miyazaki. <span>Miyazaki ruined a lot of his early work because he felt that copying Tezuka's approach was improper because it would prevent him from growing as an artist.</span></p>
                <p>Panda and the Magic Serpent (1958), which Miyazaki slipped out to watch instead of preparing for his entrance examinations, was the cartoon that first piqued his interest during his third and final year of college. Later, Miyazaki recalled how he fell in love with Bai-Niang, the movie's lead character, and how the experience deeply affected him. Following graduation, Miyazaki majored in Japanese Industrial Theory at Gakushuin University's political economics department. The nearest equivalent to a comics group at the time was the "Children's Literature Research Club," which he joined.<span> He began drawing comics around this time and produced thousands of pages of unfinished tales, though he never finished any.</span> To rent their tales, he frequently contacted manga companies. Miyazaki received degrees in political science and finance from Gakushuin in 1963.</p>
