                <h1>START OF THE CAREER</h1>
                <p><span>Miyazaki worked for Toei Animation in 1963.</span> On the television cartoon Wolf Boy Ken and the theatrical animated film Doggie March, Miyazaki contributed as a fill-in artist (both 1963). Additionally, he contributed to Gulliver's Adventures Beyond the Moon (1964). Later, Miyazaki contributed to The Great Adventure of Horus, Lord of the Sun as the film's principal animator, concept artist, and scene designer (1968). <span>While making the movie, Miyazaki collaborated closely with Yasuo Tsuka, an instructor whose method of animating had a significant impact on Miyazaki's work.</span></p>
                <p>People of the Desert, a manga written and drawn by Miyazaki under the alias Akitsu Sabur, was released between September 1969 and March 1970. He was inspired by drawn tales like Evil Lord of the Desert by Fukushima. Key animation for The Marvelous World of Puss 'n Boots was also done by Miyazaki (1969). He produced a 12-chapter comic series as a marketing complement to the movie. In the script for Flying Phantom Ship (1969), Miyazaki subsequently suggested sequences in which military tanks would create widespread panic in downtown Tokyo. <span>He was then recruited to storyboard and animate the scenes. He created the plot, the cast of characters, and the artwork for Hiroshi Ikeda's version of Animal Treasure Island in 1971.</span> For Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, Miyazaki also created the crucial animation.</p>
                <p><span>In August 1971, Miyazaki departed Toei Animation and was recruited by A-Pro, where he co-directed 23 episodes of Lupin the Third Part I with Takahata.</span> Takahata directed two Panda! Go, Panda! cartoons that Miyazaki created, planned, and animated. In June 1973, Miyazaki and Takahata relocated from A-Pro to Zuiy Eiz and began working on World Masterpiece Theater, which featured their animated series Heidi, Daughter of the Mountains, a retelling of Johanna Spyri's Heidi. In July 1975, Zuiy Eiz proceeded under the name Nippon Animation. In 1978, Miyazaki also helmed the television version of Alexander Key's The Amazing Tide, Future Boy Conan.</p>
                <p><span>The creators of Studio Ghibli, Miyazaki, Takahata, Tokuma, and Suzuki, established it in June 1985.</span> The Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986) picture, which was Studio Ghibli's debut, used the same creative team as Nausicaä. Greek building and European urbanistic models served as inspiration for Miyazaki's designs for the film's location. August 2 saw the introduction of Laputa. <span>In Japan, it was the year's highest-grossing animated movie.</span> In order to secure Studio Ghibli's financial stability, Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies and Miyazaki's subsequent feature, My Neighbor Totoro, were both published in April 1988. The artists' joint output was chaotic as they shifted between tasks. In contrast to Nausicaä, which emphasizes technology's detrimental effects on nature, My Neighbor Totoro explores the subject of the connection between the environment and humankind. <span>Although the movie was well-received by critics, but it did poorly at the box office. However, the movie's merchandise was a hit, and it became known as an underground favorite.</span></p>
