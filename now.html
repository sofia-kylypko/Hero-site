                <p>Jiro Horikoshi, the creator of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter, is the subject of a comic series by the name of The Wind Rises that Miyazaki started composing in early 2009. Two editions of the Model Graphix journal, released on February 25 and March 25, 2009, contained the manga's initial publication. <span>Later, Miyazaki collaborated on the screenplays for the films Arrietty (2010) and From Up on Poppy Hill (2011), which were both directed by Gor Miyazaki.</span> Suzuki persuaded Miyazaki to make Kaze Tachinu into a movie instead of his preferred Ponyo successor. The Wind Rises, based on Kaze Tachinu, was revealed by Studio Ghibli to be produced in November 2012 and will be published alongside Takahata's The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.</p>
                <p><span>Due to his advanced age, Miyazaki stated in September 2013 that he would stop making feature films but would still be contributing to the Studio Ghibli Museum's exhibits. Miyazaki received the Governors Awards' Academy Honors Medal in November 2014.</span> He created the computer-animated short feature Boro the Caterpillar, which was initially considered during the pre-production of Princess Mononoke. In July 2017, it was only shown at the Studio Ghibli Museum. He is also producing an unnamed manga about warriors. How Do You Live? is a new feature-length film that Miyazaki suggested in August 2016. Despite not having formal approval, he started working on the animation for the project. Studio Ghibli revealed in December 2022 that the movie would debut on July 14, 2023, in Japanese cinemas.</p>
                <p><span>A regular associate of Miyazaki's, Vincent Maraval, was said to have hinted on Twitter in January 2019 that Miyazaki might be working on a new movie.</span> Ten Years with Hayao Miyazaki, a four-part documentary that tracked the making of his movies in his personal studio, aired on the NHK network in February 2019. <span>In 2019, Miyazaki gave his blessing to a kabuki troupe's performance of a theatrical version of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.</span></p>
