                <h1><em>Why I chose him</em></h1>
                <p>I have a lot of respect for Japanese filmmaker and artist Hayao Miyazaki. <br> He enjoys great fame on a global scale. All classes enjoy watching his cartoons. Some of his works can be a little difficult to comprehend, but as you view them more and get to know their creator, the more clear they become. The majority of the author's writings express his perspective on life. <br> We can see them in almost all of his writings because he enjoyed them. Humanism, or the interaction between people and the natural world, is the primary subject of his filming. There are no overt antagonists in his animated creations. Each of his figures has a distinct purpose, vision, and drive. <br><b>I respect him as an artist, for his perspective on life and for the significant role his work has played in my life.</b></p>
