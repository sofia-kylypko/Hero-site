                <h1>HIS INFLUENCE IN WORLD</h1>
                <p>In his works, Miyazaki does away with conventional scripts and instead develops the story of the movie as he creates the storyboards. He said, "We just keep working on the picture as it develops. We never know where the plot will go. All of Miyazaki's earlier films, starting with Princess Mononoke, used computer-generated imagery to "enrich the visual look," but he makes sure that each film can "retain the right ratio between working by hand and computer... and still be able to call my films 2D." Miyazaki uses traditional animation techniques, drawing each frame by hand. He is in charge of every scene in his movies.</p>
                <p><span>Sanpei Shirato, Osamu Tezuka, Soji Yamakawa, and Isao Takahata are just a few of the Japanese painters Miyazaki has named as inspirations. Frédéric Back, Lewis Carroll, Roald Dahl, Jean Giraud, Paul Grimault, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Yuri Norstein, as well as the cartoon company Aardman Animations, have all inspired his writing (specifically the works of Nick Park).</span> Animal Farm (1945), The Snow Queen (1957), and The King and the Mockingbird (1980) are three specific works that have inspired Miyazaki; The Snow Queen is thought to be the real spark for Miyazaki's filmmaking, shaping his training and work. Miyazaki frequently draws motivation for his animated works for young audiences from the kids of his friends as well as his own childhood recollections.</p>
